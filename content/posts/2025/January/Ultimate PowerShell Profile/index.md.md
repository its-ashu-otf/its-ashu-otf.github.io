# PowerShell Profile: Linux Terminal Experience on Windows

PowerShell is already powerful on its own, but with a few tweaks and enhancements, you can transform it into a Linux-like terminal experienceâ€”right on your Windows machine. This blog walks you through setting up a custom PowerShell profile that comes preloaded with quality-of-life improvements, aliases, and shortcuts to supercharge your terminal experience.

## âš¡ One-Line Install

Getting started is quick and easy. Open an **elevated PowerShell window** (run PowerShell as Administrator) and execute the following command:

```powershell
irm "https://github.com/its-ashu-otf/powershell-profile/raw/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

This script sets up a PowerShell profile that not only mimics a Linux terminal but also introduces productivity-enhancing features.

## ðŸ”§ Fixing the Missing Font Issue

After running the script, you'll notice that some icons or glyphs might not render correctly. Thatâ€™s because your current font doesnâ€™t support Nerd Fonts. Here are two simple options to resolve this:

### Option 1: Manual Installation

1. After running the script, youâ€™ll find a downloaded file named `cove.zip` in the folder where you executed the setup.
2. Extract the `cove.zip` file.
3. Locate the patched **Caskadia Mono Nerd Font Family** files.
4. Install these fonts by right-clicking on each file and selecting "Install for all users."

### Option 2: Automated Installation with Oh-My-Posh

The PowerShell profile comes preloaded with **Oh-My-Posh**, a powerful prompt theme engine. You can use it to install a Nerd Font effortlessly:

1. Run the following command:
    
    ```powershell
    oh-my-posh font install
    ```
    
2. Youâ€™ll see a list of available Nerd Fonts like this:
    
    ```
    PS> oh-my-posh font install
    
       Select font
    
     > 0xProto
       3270
       Agave
       AnonymousPro
       Arimo
       AurulentSansMono
       BigBlueTerminal
       BitstreamVeraSansMono
    
       â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢
       â†‘/k up â€¢ â†“/j down â€¢ q quit â€¢ ? more
    ```
    
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate, select your desired font, and press **Enter** to install it.

## ðŸŽ¨ Customizing Your PowerShell Profile

One key feature of this setup is that the main profile file, `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`, is protected. Any changes you make to this file will be overwritten by future updates from the repository. Instead, follow these steps to create your own custom profile:

1. After installation, run the following command:
    
    ```powershell
    Edit-Profile
    ```
    
2. This will create a new profile file named `profile.ps1` for your current user.
    
3. Open the file in your preferred text editor (e.g., VS Code, Notepad++).
    
4. Add any custom aliases, functions, or shortcuts here. For example:
    
    ```powershell
    # Example Alias
    Set-Alias ll Get-ChildItem
    
    # Example Function
    function cdls {
        param (
            [string]$Path
        )
        Set-Location $Path
        Get-ChildItem
    }
    ```
    
5. Save the file and reload your PowerShell session to apply the changes.
